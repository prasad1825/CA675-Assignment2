----------Connecting BigQuery to Python
--------environment: Notebook on GOOGLE COLAB------------------
--1. Install the Python BigQuery dependency as follows

!pip install --upgrade google-cloud-BigQuery
!pip install --upgrade 'google-cloud-bigquery[bqstorage,pandas]'
!pip install google-cloud-bigquery-storage

--2. Set up a service account to access BigQuery from external libraries on the Google cloud service account page
---2.1. Create service account. Role as owner/editor
---2.2. Create prive key on the service account
-- ---> ca675-project-4f8ddd72be93.json was created and downloaded automatically to local computer after private key had been created on the service account of the project namely CA675-A2-2020-new /GCP.

--3. Upload file .json to google drive for later stages. 
--4. Import drive into COLAB

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

--5. setup environment variables for the Python script to use while accessing BigQuery

import os
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"]="/content/drive/MyDrive/ca675-project-4f8ddd72be93.json"
 
--6. Use the python client library to create a script to access datasets available in BigQuerry

from google.cloud import bigquery
client = bigquery.Client()

sql = """
